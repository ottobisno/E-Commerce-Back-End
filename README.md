# E-Commerce Back-end

## Description

This application allows the user to perform CRUD operations on their E-commerce database. The database consists of caegories, products, and tags associated with each product. The endpoints for each table in the database (categories, products, tags) allow the user to view data from each table, view specific rows of data from each table, add new rows of data to each table, update specific rows of data from each table, and delete specific rows of data from each table. This application currently has no front-end component, so all operations must be carried out manually by using a tool such as Insomnia.

## Future Improvements

Add a front-end interface for this application, so that rather than manually putting together request bodies, the user can enter information into a form, which would be handled automatically before fetching the routes from the back-end.
